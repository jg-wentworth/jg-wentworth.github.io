&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a blog that will record my thoughts on an upcoming Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) 
tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) sandbox-style megadungeon campaign set in the setting 
illustrated in [The Halls of Arden Vul](https://ardenvul.com/), published by Expeditious 
Retreat Press.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the campaign will be to answer a simple question: "Can a megadungeon, run in an old-school manner, be completed** using the (modified) DCC ruleset?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will do my best to run this campaign mainly aligned with the principles set out in [Muster: A Primer for War](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/muster-an-old-school-primer#/) an "introduction to the particular ethos and technique of playing D&D as a wargame, a kriegsspiel."

**By completed, I mean mostly explored, with the players reaching the deepest level.
