### Session 2 Judge's Notes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We finally had a session start at the planned time (well, almost, we 
stalled for about half an hour as Bill and Jake wanted to grab food and drinks or something, 
sheesh). We also waited for Sam, who no-call-no-showed, unfortunately. I'm going to get his number 
from Bill and text him next time, I don't think he really knows how to use Discord. About an hour 
and a half after starting, Mark showed up. 

Attendance so far as been [on time, (late), /absent/]: 

* Session 0: Brad, Bill, (Mark), /Jake/, /Sam/, /Earl/
* Session 1: Brad, Bill, Jake, (Sam), /Mark/, /Earl/
* Session 2: Brad, Bill, Jake, (Mark), /Sam/, /Earl/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average, then, is 2-3 on-time, 1 late, and 2-3 absent out of 6 
players. Not great, if you ask me. I will stay the course for now, but if our player count 
continues to hover around 3 or 4, I might just start inviting new people, even though this 
runs the risk of sessions with more than six players (which can be difficult).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party looted just enough out of the Tower of Scrutiny without 
stumbling upon the grave dangers there. I feel like this was extremely lucky! However, they 
did make the right choice based on the information they received (lots of dead bodies, a stench
of death). They then went to unbury a cellar and found the arm of the marble statue. I made a 
mistake here, and forgot to tell them that there was a staircase here to SL-4. Whoops! I will 
fix this next session by telling them that they see a secret door that someone left open in the 
cellar they already investigated. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that I gave them two rumors that I hoped would point them 
to either the Pyramid of Thoth or Level 1 (both relatively beginner-friendly areas), they seemed 
to ignore those rumors and have no discussion of them and marched over to AV-29, the Palace Ruins.
There, they quickly scaled the wall and went to the indoor garden level. They encountered the 
deadly 15HD assassin vine there. However, I made another mistake! When I read the text, I somehow 
thought that the vine had only 3 vine attacks per turn, when it's actually 24! I realized this in 
the second round of combat, and so decided to just add three extra vines per turn. Two or more 
members of the party likely would have died if I read the vine entry correctly. We ended the 
session with Basil, Marcellus, Spine, and Sarnai all ensnared, but a raging fire started by Pif 
may, if the party is lucky, burn away 2-3 of the vines, leaving 2-3 that would need to be cut away 
for everyone to escape. They're in trouble, but at least some of them will have a chance to escape!
