### Session 1 Judge's Notes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a quick two-hour session due to attendance issues. We started 
with only Bill, Brad, and Jake, with Sam joining about an hour late. Attendance is my main concern for the 
campaign's longevity at this point, but we shall see.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this session, we rolled a character for Sam (Marcellus the Chaotic 
Cleric) and played for a little bit. I asked Sam what God he wanted to worship, and he said an 
"evil" god, so we went with Atashak. This could set up some spiciness with Jake's character Pif, who 
worships the Lawful Goddess Demma! However, Sam is new to TTRPG's, so maybe not.

Players and their characters:

| Player      | Character   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Bill        | Spine       |
| Brad        | Waldorf     |
| Jake        | Pif         |
| Mark        | Battista    |
| Sam         | Marcellus   |
| Earl        | NOT CREATED |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the session, someone asked "what's this thing" and pinged the Tower 
of Scrutiny. I told them it was a four-story tower, and they got all excited and went straight for 
it. They scouted around it, and Battista, of course, discovered the secret door. At this point, I 
was quite worried for them.
