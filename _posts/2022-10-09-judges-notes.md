session.

## Judge's Thoughts

### Session 0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We basically just rolled characters this session and introduced everyone 
to the campaign structure and setting. Brad and Bill joined initially, with Mark joining about an 
hour and a half late. Sessions start at 18:30, and Mark can only join at 19:30 at the earliest. I 
hope this won't be too much of a problem. Our stated policy of always playing, even with only one 
player present (with the Judge or present players controlling the absent players' characters), will
hopefully mitigate this. My goal is to try to play each week, no matter what, to build consistency 
and momentum, and also allow the players to be able to rely on the game being played each week.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently have six players who have stated that they want to play in the 
campaign: Bill, Brad, Jake, Mark, Sam, and Earl. Earl said ahead of time that he would be absent the first 
two sessions, and Jake also said that he couldn't make session zero in advance. Sam missed the first 
session due to communication issues. As time goes on, if people keep missing sessions, I may need 
to recruit more players. Possible options are Kevin, Ivan, or putting out advertisements on the 
internet. I don't want to have to kick people out of the campaign, but maybe I won't have to. 
Sometimes, players just slowly stop attending in campaigns where sessions are played without 
full attendance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first time using Foundry VTT, and I decided that I really liked
it. I think the players did too. It was a bit of a pain to find all of the tables needed to roll 
for our characters in the UI, but I believe this will get easier with practice. We also had some 
issues with folks navigating the invite and join process, but I also think this will get easier 
over time. Doing this campaign in a VTT takes up a lot of prep time. I think most of my prep time 
is spent on the following, in order of most time taken:

1. Adding monster stats and tokens to Foundry
2. Adding and configuring the maps to Foundry, including placing walls, light sources, and 
creatures
3. Editing the module's PDF to underline sentences in the room keys that need to be narrated to 
the players, as well as underlining trap and monster triggers, secret doors, etc.
4. Reading the module (it clocks in at over 1,200 pages, so this does take significant time)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I'm not too worried about the prep time, as it's mostly 
front-loaded, and I sort of enjoy it. Right now, I need to make the maps for Sub-levels 1 and 4 in 
Dungeondraft, as well as upload, configure, and populate them. I need to try to get this done 
before the next session, as the party may stumble across entrances to those levels based on their 
current path.
