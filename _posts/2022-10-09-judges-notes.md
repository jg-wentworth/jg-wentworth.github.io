## Judge's Thoughts

### Session 0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We basically just rolled characters this session and introduced everyone 
to the campaign structure and setting. BD and BG joined initially, with ML joining about an 
hour and a half late. Sessions start at 18:30, and ML can only join at 19:30 at the earliest. I 
hope this won't be too much of a problem. Our stated policy of always playing, even with only one 
player present (with the Judge or present players controlling the absent players' characters), will
hopefully mitigate this. My goal is to try to play each week, no matter what, to build consistency 
and momentum, and also allow the players to be able to rely on the game being played each week.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently have six players who have stated that they want to play in the 
campaign: BG, BD, JP, ML, SM, and EK. EK said ahead of time that he would be absent the first 
two sessions, and JP also said that he couldn't make session zero in advance. SM missed the first 
session due to communication issues. As time goes on, if people keep missing sessions, I may need 
to recruit more players. Possible options are KD, IG, or putting out advertisements on the 
internet. I don't want to have to kick people out of the campaign, but maybe I won't have to. 
Sometimes, players just slowly stop attending in campaigns where sessions are played without 
full attendance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first time using Foundry VTT, and I decided that I really liked
it. I think the players did too. It was a bit of a pain to find all of the tables needed to roll 
for our characters in the UI, but I believe this will get easier with practice. We also had some 
issues with folks navigating the invite and join process, but I also think this will get easier 
over time. Doing this campaign in a VTT takes up a lot of prep time. I think most of my prep time 
is spent on the following, in order of most time taken:

1. Adding monster stats and tokens to Foundry
2. Adding and configuring the maps to Foundry, including placing walls, light sources, and 
creatures
3. Editing the module's PDF to underline sentences in the room keys that need to be narrated to 
the players, as well as underlining trap and monster triggers, secret doors, etc.
4. Reading the module (it clocks in at over 1,200 pages, so this does take significant time)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I'm not too worried about the prep time, as it's mostly 
front-loaded, and I sort of enjoy it. Right now, I need to make the maps for Sub-levels 1 and 4 in 
Dungeondraft, as well as upload, configure, and populate them. I need to try to get this done 
before the next session, as the party may stumble across entrances to those levels based on their 
current path.

### Session 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a quick two-hour session due to attendance issues. We started 
with only BG, BD, and JP, with SM joining about an hour late. Attendance is my main concern for the 
campaign's longevity at this point, but we shall see.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this session, we rolled a character for SM (Marcellus the Chaotic 
Cleric) and played for a little bit. I asked SM what God he wanted to worship, and he said an 
"evil" god, so we went with Atashak. This could set up some spiciness with JP's character Pif, who 
worships the Lawful Goddess Demma! However, SM is new to TTRPG's, so maybe not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the session, someone asked "what's this thing" and pinged the Tower 
of Scrutiny. I told them it was a four-story tower, and they got all excited and went straight for 
it. They scouted around it, and Battista, of course, discovered the secret door. At this point, I 
was quite worried for them.

### Session 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We finally had a session start at the planned time (well, almost, we 
stalled for about half an hour as BG and JP wanted to grab food and drinks or something, 
sheesh). We also waited for SM, who no-call-no-showed, unfortunately. I'm going to get his number 
from BG and text him next time, I don't think he really knows how to use Discord. About an hour 
and a half after starting, ML showed up. 

Attendance so far as been [on time, (late), /absent/]: 

Session 0: BD, BG, (ML), /JP/, /SM/, /EK/
Session 1: BD, BG, JP, (SM), /ML/, /EK/
Session 2: BD, BG, JP, (ML), /SM/, /EK/

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average, then, is 2-3 on-time, 1 late, and 2-3 absent out of 6 
players. Not great, if you ask me. I will stay the course for now, but if our player count 
continues to hover around 3 or 4, I might just start inviting new people, even though this 
runs the risk of sessions with more than six players (which can be difficult).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party looted just enough out of the Tower of Scrutiny without 
stumbling upon the grave dangers there. I feel like this was extremely lucky! However, they 
did make the right choice based on the information they received (lots of dead bodies, a stench
of death). They then went to unbury a cellar and found the arm of the marble statue. I made a 
mistake here, and forgot to tell them that there was a staircase here to SL-4. Whoops! I will 
fix this next session by telling them that they see a secret door that someone left open in the 
cellar they already investigated. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that I gave them two rumors that I hoped would point them 
to either the Pyramid of Thoth or Level 1 (both relatively beginner-friendly areas), they seemed 
to ignore those rumors and have no discussion of them and marched over to AV-29, the Palace Ruins.
There, they quickly scaled the wall and went to the indoor garden level. They encountered the
