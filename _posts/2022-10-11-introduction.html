	  <h1>Introduction</h1>
				<br>
            <p>This is a blog that will record my thoughts on an upcoming Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) 
    tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) sandbox-style megadungeon campaign set in the setting 
    illustrated in <a href="https://ardenvul.com/">The Halls of Arden Vul</a>, published by Expeditious 
    Retreat Press.<br>
    <br>
        The goal of the campaign will be to run one mainly aligned with the principles set out in <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/muster-an-old-school-primer#/">Muster: A Primer for War</a>
    an "introduction to the particular ethos and technique of playing D&D as a wargame, a <em>kriegsspiel</em>.<br>
<br>
        During the campaign, I, acting as the "Judge" (DM, GM, Referee), will attempt, hopefully 
    with the assistance of the players, to abide by the Three Cornerstones as outlined in <em>Muster</em>:<br>
					<h3>1. Neutral Referee</h3>
                <blockquote>The Game Master is a referee; their task is to prepare a challenging scenario and 
                conduct it fairly to whatever outcome. Teaching the rules, and adjudicating the 
                events. The referee does not have a plan for what will happen in the game. They do 
                not play favourites, they do not cheat the rules, and they will, ultimately, share 
                in the celebration or commiseration of the outcome. A referee who is not responsible
                for outcomes leaves room for the other players to have real agency.</blockquote>

	  <h3>2. Real Achievement</h3>
                <blockquote>This is a game of skill and daring, played against quantifiable adversity. It’s 
                not a theatrical show; you’re not playacting inside the Game Master’s planned 
                story. Naturally, this means that losses are real as well. Exhilarating to avoid, 
                depressing to face. But you learn from them, because they are real. Real 
                achievement, real pride, real learning and real sportsmanship are only possible 
                when the game is real.</blockquote>
	  <h3>3. Simulation Rules</h3>
                <blockquote>The game is a conflict simulation, its purpose to shed light to how things work; 
                teach reality, use reality. It is not a boardgame, conveniently self-enclosed 
                and fair. Players maneuver against the imagined scenario and how it should work. 
                The referee exists to apply and adapt the rules to reflect the scenario. The ideal 
                of simulating a reality, even a fantastic one, is always an aspiration and a 
                compromise between gameability and insight. The game treads a golden mean to 
                capture anything real while remaining fun and fluid. The right mechanical tools 
                for the task depend on the group’s developing skills and interests.</blockquote>
    
        To facilitate the above, I have implemented the following game structure, also taken from 
	  <em>Muster</em>:<br>
<ol>
	<li><b>Quick character generation</b> through automated tables in Foundry VTT.</li>
            <li><b>No backstories.</b> More than 2-sentence backstories are discouraged.</li>
            <li><b>Start at first level, always.</b> Anything else skews perspective.</li>
            <li><b>Character death is a necessity.</b> It keeps the game honest.</li>
            <li><b>Use of character stables.</b> Players can make as many new characters as they like.</li>
            <li><b>XP is goal-based, only granted for gold.</b> 1gp = 1xp.</li>
            <li><b>XP is consistent and serious.</b> It is respected as a sign of achievement. There will be no pity points.</li>
            <li><b>There is no balance.</b> Players may retreat if they wish.</li>
            <li><b>No cheating.</b> I will not fudge anything, ever.</li><br>
